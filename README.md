## Overview

This repository contains demonstration notebooks for predictive analytics, focusing on classification techniques. The goal is to provide clear examples of how to preprocess data, train classification models, evaluate performance, and interpret results.

Currently included methods:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier

- **Classification_random_forest_classifier.ipynb** — Notebook walkthrough using random forest.  
- **test1.txt** — A sample or placeholder text file (you may clarify or remove).  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Common Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

You can install dependencies using `pip` or `conda` as shown below.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parajulibh/predictive_analytics.git
   cd predictive_analytics
   ```

2. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note:** If you don’t yet have a `requirements.txt`, you can generate one via:  
   > ```bash
   > pip freeze > requirements.txt
   > ```

## Usage / Examples

Open and run the notebooks:

- **`Classification_logistic_regression.ipynb`** — step-by-step modeling with logistic regression  
- **`Classification_random_forest_classifier.ipynb`** — modeling with random forest  

Each notebook typically follows this flow:

1. Import and inspect data  
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
3. Model training  
4. Model evaluation (metrics, confusion matrix, etc.)  
5. Interpretation or discussion  

You can reuse or adapt these notebooks for your own datasets by modifying data loading cells and tweaking model hyperparameters.

## Notebooks & Methods

| Notebook | Method | Key Focus |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| `Classification_logistic_regression.ipynb` | Logistic Regression | Linear classification, interpretability |
| `Classification_random_forest_classifier.ipynb` | Random Forest | Ensemble learning, feature importance |

As the project evolves, you may add more notebooks (e.g., SVM, neural networks, clustering) or regression analysis.

## Data

This repo currently does not include external datasets. You may link your own dataset paths or import from sklearn sample datasets.

## Results & Discussion

Each notebook contains model performance outputs (e.g., accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix). Future updates may include comparative analyses and hyperparameter optimization.
